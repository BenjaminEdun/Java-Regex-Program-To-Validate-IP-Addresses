# Java-Regex-Program-To-Validate-IP-Addresses


This is a Java Program file written to validate IP addresses

This is a program that uses regular expression to validate an IP address input by a user. This program is implemented by using the Java String method "matches(String regex)" which returns a boolean (true or false) by comparing a user input to a regular expression. The program could also have been implemented by importing the Matcher and Pattern classes from java.util.regex .
